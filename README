This README file contains information on the contents of the
mythos layer.


MythOS is the real-time embedded Linux distribution for Aeon
class spacecraft. Derived from Poky, MythOS provides a rich
Linux environment with networking and Ruby on Rails. The target
processors include the Freescale PPC Systems on a Chip (SOC)
models p1010 and p2020. The p1010 is used only for some development
testing in late 2013 and early 2014. Thereafter, MythOS will target
the QEMU PPC, the p2020 SOC, and the RAD750.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  layers: meta-poky
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-fsl-ppc
  layers: meta-fsl-ppc
  branch: master


And once I figure out exactly how to integrate
with this build, this will also depend upon
Rails, Ruby, and other tools including a
lightweight web server and a database engine.

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  layers: meta-poky
  branch: master


Patches

I. Adding the mythos layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the mythos layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the mythos layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g., for the p1010, p2020 (and probably the
RAD750) builds:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-mythos \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-fsl-ppc \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-oe/meta-oe \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-oe/meta-ruby \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-oe/meta-webserver \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-qt3 \
    "


In addition, in your local.conf you will need to specify the distro to
be mythos, and you will need to specify an appropriate machine, such as:

  MACHINE = "p2020rdb"
  DISTRO = "mythos"
